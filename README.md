# Library


## About

- The Library project is part of The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum. For this project, had to learn about and use constructors. 

- To change the reading status, just hover and click.

- As of 9/15/2022, this project does not have local storage. Will add later on as I make progress in the course.



## Resources

- [JavaScript BookList App | No Frameworks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMCxVWtW58&t=792s) - I used this tutorial to create class constructors and form validation. I did change some of the code and also added new lines of code to get the form and "book cards" to be displayed and function properly.
